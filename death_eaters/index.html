            <h3>Bellatrix Lestrange</h3>
            <p>A fictional character in the Harry Potter book series written by J.K. Rowling. She went from
                an unnamed
                minor character in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire to the main antagonist in subsequent
                novels. In
                the final part of the story, Rowling called her Lord Voldemort's "last, best lieutenant."
                Bellatrix was
                the first female Death Eater featured in the books. Bellatrix was fanatically obsessed with
                the Dark
                Lord, although she was clearly afraid of his magical abilities and absolute power over his
                powers. She
                is almost as sadistic and a murderer as Lord Voldemort, with a psychopathic personality.</p>
