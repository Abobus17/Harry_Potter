                <p>A young professor of Muggle studies. Before becoming a defense against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Quirrell made a great trip around the world.
                    Quirrell deliberately went in search of the Dark Wizard, partly out of curiosity, partly out of a desire to become more important. Quirrell dreamed that, at the very least, he could become the man who tracked down Voldemort, and at best, also get such knowledge from Voldemort that hardly anyone would dare to make fun of the professor later.</p>
